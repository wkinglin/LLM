Firm X's production cost is 0. Firm Y's production cost is 10. If no consumer discriminates, then each consumer buys from the firm with the lower price.

Suppose that the government taxes firm X by 50 dollars. Draw the new price schedule.\nAnswer:i. The price schedule is unchanged because consumer A continues to buy from the lower priced firm.\nii. Consumer B buys from the higher priced firm. Since consumer A continues to buy from the lower priced firm, the market price is greater than the marginal cost of producing the good.
